# The solution to the problem is proffered by this laravel 10+ application

# The solutions involves using a service layer to construct the logic and return a finished sorted array depending on the sorting mechanism involved

# There are two service classes involved here, one of which load the static data (App/Services/LoadProducts.php), and the other which sorts the data (App/Services/Catalogue.php).

# Finally a controller file (Ap/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php) which calls the service class to output sorted data when the respective routes are called

# routes are written in the traditional web.php file
